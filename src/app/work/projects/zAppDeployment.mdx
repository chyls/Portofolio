## Overview

An app named Handy was given to us an was to be deployed using a combination of Azure, K8s and terraform.

## Key Features

- Used an infrastructure as code to manage computer data and resources
- Had a working frontend, backend as well as database


## Technologies Used

- Terraform: Used as a baseline infrastructure for our deployment, specifying what type of vm is used, and creating its resource groups
- Azure: Cloud platform that was used in its deployment
- K8s: A tool used to orchestrate all deployed containers
- Docker: Deployment tool that allows us to deploy an app using a container.

## Challenges and Learnings

This was the first time where we would use the theories and lessons we've had in class in practice, though it also included multiple variables that weren't present in lectures, that we had to solve on our own, such as the inclusion of databases and backend features.

## Outcome

The app was deployed using our individual Azure student accounts, though without a domain name.
