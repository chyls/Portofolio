## Overview

Development of a short RPG game, focusing on the mental issues such as anxiety and loyalty.

## Key Features

- 2 Playable Protagonists, each with unique animations & sprites.
- Story-driven game.
- Completely free & accessible right now.


## Technologies Used

- RPGMaker XP: Used as the game engine.
- Aseprite: Main software used by our lead designer to create character & enemy sprites
- GIMP/Photoshop: Used to create certain textures & tilesets

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing between our vastly different schedules, as well as the added pressure of having to attend classes and exams while developing this game at the same time. Our solution? Having crystal clear communication on what we are creating, while also maintaining teamwork as we develop this project.

## Outcome

The prototype for this game is now fully available, and free to download, with a game that spans for around 5-15 minutes.
